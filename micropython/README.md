EnCo MicroPython example
========================

Welcome to the MicroPython based authentication example.
This example will perform the following steps:

1. Security initialisation
1. Retrieval of the userinfo
1. Interprete the JSON answer in a structured way

To use this example, make sure to have your WiPy properly installed.
(Other embedded devices with MicroPython are available, but have not been tested.)

For this example to work, you will also need the to install the **http_client.py** in 
the lib folder to the lib folder of the WiPy.

If you are not yet familiar with the WiPy, you will find getting started information on our [**documentation site**](http://docs.enco.io/) as well.

After transferring the example file to the WiPy, you can execute it in the standard way:

> execfile('uauthenticationsample.py')

MQTT example
------------

The second example (mqtttocc.py) uses MQTT (provided by lib/simple.py) to publish a message to a CloudChannel.

The full description and setup is available [**here**](http://docs.enco.io/docs/wipy-mqtt-cc).
