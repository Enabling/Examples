EnCo PHP example
================

Welcome to the PHP based authentication example.
This example will perform the following steps:

1. Security initialisation
1. Retrieval of the userinfo
1. Interprete the JSON answer in a structured way

To use this example, make sure to have PHP properly installed.

For this example to work, you will also need the [**Httpful library**](http://phphttpclient.com/) 
installed. Note that while a version of this library has been provided with the example, this library does
depend on php-curl, so make sure that is available within your environment as well
(use 'sudo apt-get install php-curl' if you haven't already).

To run the example, you can execute the script with:

> php -f authenticationsamplehttpful.php


You're welcome to have a go with these and we welcome your comments, feedback, improvements, questions, ....

And if needed, you will find related information on our [**documentation site**](http://docs.enco.io/) as well.

Cheers,
The EnCo team.
