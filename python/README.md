EnCo Python example
===================

Welcome to the Python based authentication example.
This example will perform the following steps:

1. Security initialisation
1. Retrieval of the userinfo
1. Interprete the JSON answer in a structured way

To use this example, make sure to have Python properly installed.

For this example to work, you will also need the [**requests library**](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) 
installed.

If you are not yet familiar with Python, we advise that you work within a virtual environment.
For example, you can setup a virtualenv **myenco** in the following way:

1. virtualenv myenco
1. cd myenco
1. bin/pip install requests

This environment can then be used to execute the example:

> bin/python authenticationsamplerequests.py


You're welcome to have a go with these and we welcome your comments, feedback, improvements, questions, ....

And if needed, you will find related information on our [**documentation site**](http://docs.enco.io/) as well.

Cheers,
The EnCo team.
