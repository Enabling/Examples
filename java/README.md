EnCo Java example
=================

Currently we have an example **authenticationsamplespring** that will guide you through
the security initialisation and show you how to use the userinfo function to retrieve
your own information in a structured way.

The example finishes with an attempt to retrieve your SeAAS devices, but this will only 
succeed if you have subscribed to the SeAAS asset.


You're welcome to have a go with these and we welcome your comments, feedback, improvements, questions, ....

And if needed, you will find related information on our [**documentation site**](http://docs.enco.io/) as well.

Cheers,
The EnCo team.
